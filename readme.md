# About the App

This App is one of the coding BootCamp assignments at University of Minnesota. The App is about creating a workout tracker. It allows users to view create and track daily workouts. Users can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they also can track their distance traveled. Users can display dashboard to show their workout data in graph.
